"train" and "test" both come from the "train" set from ASIRRA via KAGGLE :

The "real" test set doesn't have labels so we can't use that.

So we just arbitrarily nabbed a piece and called it the test set.

In the future we should really do K-fold cross validation and report the average accuracies etc.
